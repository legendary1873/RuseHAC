## Architecture Decisions

**Why Django + DRF?**
- Batteries included (auth, admin, ORM)
- Excellent for complex permissions
- Great ecosystem (serializers, viewsets)
- Built-in admin panel for execs
- Easy to add Celery for async tasks

**Why JWT?**
- Stateless authentication
- Works great with single-page apps
- Secure token-based approach
- Easy token refresh

**Why this structure?**
- Modular apps (accounts, core, shop, ballots)
- Easy to scale and test
- Clear separation of concerns
- Ready for microservices if needed
